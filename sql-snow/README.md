# SQL Snow ❄️

![Preview](./snow.gif)

No white Christmas outside? No problem. This is a generative ASCII snowfall animation built in Python - a cheap but charming replacement for the real thing. ⛄

Dots and asterisks drift down the terminal in randomized patterns, creating a surprisingly hypnotic winter atmosphere. Sometimes the best visualizations don't need axes or legends, just a little seasonal spirit and a few lines of code.

Stay warm. 🎄
